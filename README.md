# Bicing-Avaiability-Prediction

## Introduction

Repository created to organize the code regarding the Bicing Avaiability Prediction Project for the Data Science and Machine Learning course.


## Objective

- To explore data in a 'real world' setting.
- To identify relevant insights and patterns.
- To develop a competitive model.

## Tasks

### 1. Prediction:

- Predict the percentage of free docks given the historical data of each station.

### 2. Study cases:

- Explore new places where stations are needed.

- Explore how different events affect availability.

## To do

- Understand the data.
- Format the data according to the Kaggle submission format.

- Create a smaller dataset with 3 partitions: train/validation/test.
- Create a regressor model that receives the data and predicts the avaiability.
- Improve the performance of the model.
- Include data from other sources: weather, calendar, etc.
- Create a Streamlit app to visualize the predictions.
